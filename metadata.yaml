  JIMM is a special type of Juju controller, used in conjunction with the Juju dashboard and a suite 
  of other services to provide greater capabilities to Juju. JIMM acts as an authorization gateway 
  and central access point for your Juju controllers.
  
  Some of the features that JIMM enables include:
   - A seamless way to manage models on various controllers, 
   - Fine grained access control
   - Federated login via OIDC.

  JIMM is just one component in a suite of tools that enables these features. When deployed as a whole
  we refer to this setup as JAAS (Juju As A Service).
